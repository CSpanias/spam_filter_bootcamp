## SPAM FILTER
The goal of this project was to create a spam filter.  

This was an assignment during the [Skills Bootcamp in Artificial Intelligence](https://instituteofcoding.org/skillsbootcamps/course/skills-bootcamp-in-artificial-intelligence/).  

It was intended to be presented as a form of presentation, thus, the code is as clearly explained as possible in a step-by-step fashion.

Tools:
- Google Collab
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, ipython, wordcloud, scikit-learn, nltk)
- Jupyter Notebooks (slideshow)
  
 Algorithms used:
- Multinomial Naive-Bayes
- Support Vector Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

Learned about:
- NLP general concepts (tokenization)
- Object manipulation with nltk
- Evaluation metrics
- Stratified kFold Cross-Validation
- Hyperparameter Optimization with GridSearchCV
