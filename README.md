## SPAM FILTER
The goal of this project was to create a spam filter.  

This was an assignment during the [Skills Bootcamp in Artificial Intelligence](https://instituteofcoding.org/skillsbootcamps/course/skills-bootcamp-in-artificial-intelligence/).  

It was intended to be presented as a form of presentation, thus, the code is as clearly explained as possible in a step-by-step fashion.

Tools:
- Google Collab
- Python (Scikit, nltk)
  
 Algorithms used:
- Multinomial Naive-Bayes
- Support Vector Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier

Learned about:
- NLP
- nltk
- Null Accuracy
- kFold Cross-Validation
- Hyperparameter Optimization with GridSearchCV
